# AI Search Algorithms Repository
Welcome to the AI Search Algorithms Repository! This repository contains implementations of various AI search algorithms and solutions to problems utilizing these algorithms. Whether you're a student, researcher, or developer interested in AI, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing search algorithms.

# Algorithms Implemented:
* Minimax: A decision-making algorithm used in two-player games to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.

* Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimization technique used in Minimax algorithm to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.

* Breadth-First Search (BFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
* Depth-First Search (DFS): A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
* A*: A best-first search algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one goal node out of one or more possible goal nodes.
* Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS): A combination of BFS and DFS algorithms that combines the benefits of both strategies for searching large state spaces.
  
# Problems Solved:
This repository also contains solutions to various problems using the implemented search algorithms, including but not limited to:

* Eight Puzzle
* Maximizing Profit in investment
* Finding shortest path
